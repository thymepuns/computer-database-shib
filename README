This is the play-shib (Scala Hibernate) version of the computer database sample.  In addition to what that sample already demonstrates, it shows:
- Accessing a JDBC database using play-shib.
- Achieving, table pagination and CRUD forms.

As play-shib is really just a demo at this point, there are many deficiencies that will (or at least could be) eventually resolved:
- Use of HQL instead of a strongly typed query
- No macro-generated "update" method that lets you update relationships
- No by-name or default parameters in macro methods (macro limitation, but a better interface could be provided)
